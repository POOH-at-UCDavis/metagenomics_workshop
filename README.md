## Code of Conduct
Please abide by The Carpentries Code of Conduct for this workshop. 
This workshop is a community building initiative for metagenomics researchers on campus, and we ask that you support our community by being respectful to other learners. In particular, note that this is not an intellectual contest, we're all here to learn (including our instructional team!), and everyone has something valuble to contribute to our research community.
